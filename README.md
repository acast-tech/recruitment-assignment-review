# Recruitment Assignment: Code Review

## Premise

Acast is growing fast and we are hiring a lot of new people. Being part of the development team, we need your help to review a code assigment from a potential candidate. The code _works in practice_, but the solution is questionable and has a lot of room for improvement.

Prepare some notes for a code review together with your team.

## Interview and assessment

During the interview, we want to hear your thoughts about the candidate's code. Treat it as if you were reviewing code submitted by a team member or colleague.

Our goal with this task is to create a discussion around the submitted code. We are not trying to trick you or expect you to find any particular issue.

If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to bring them up at any time before or during the interview.
